# CS50 2020 problem set solutions

I originally uploaded these each in individual repos, which I suppose makes sense if you want to treat them as separate actively-developed apps, but they never really were and now definitely aren't. I've archived all my old Flatiron bootcamp repos and will archive the individual repos for these too, but these are more interesting as isolated of code than the Flatiron stuff, so I'm making this repo as a single place to explore the code/refer to them.

## Final project

In addition to the problem sets, there was a final project. I made [an extension that evaluates the readability of selected text](https://github.com/yndajas/selected-text-readability).
